## Overview of the Analysis

### Background 

This project analyse the summary statistics of temperature data that were requested for the months of June and December, in order to determine if a prospective surf and ice-cream businesses can sustainably operate year-round as opposed to a seasonal business.

### Purpose 

Purpose of this analysis is to deliver:

Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis (README.md)


## Results

Key Differences in Weather: Oahu, Hawaii

The average recorded temperature in June is about 75 degrees F, 4 degrees higher than the average temp in December.
This represents a -5% change in average temperature from June to December

The frequency of temperatures recorded in June tends to have a much more normal, tight bell curve distribution, cooroborated by the smaller std measure of June temps vs December temps
The December temperatures seem to be more variable than those in June given its larger range in recorded temperatures (comparing the max vs min temp of each month)

However, when looking at the plotted distribution of Dec Temps, we can see that the median temperature in Dec is more inline with the average, and there are not many outliers skuing the average temperature higher or lower than the actual recorded frequency.



## Summary

Overall from the results it can be stated that,The average temperatures in June and December differ only by 4 degree F which is not a big difference. So there is good chance that the surf and ice-cream business can sustain in month of June as well as December.
-------
Before summerizing anything it would be good idea to get more information on each months data like;

1.Precipation  difference between June and December to determine is one has more rainy weather.
2. Wind Conditions and wave swell. 
3. comaparison by weather station, as we may see higher/lower temperatures and precipitation levels at different locations. We would be primarily interested in the weather station closest to our prospective location, which would narrow the results and provide the best data for us to consider.
