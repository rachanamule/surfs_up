## Overview of the Analysis

### Background 

This project analyse the summary statistics of temperature data that were requested for the months of June and December, in order to determine if a prospective surf and ice-cream businesses can sustainably operate year-round as opposed to a seasonal business.

### Purpose 

Purpose of this analysis is to deliver:

* Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June

* Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December

* Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis (README.md)


## Results





## Summary

Overall from the results it can be stated that,The average temperatures in June and December differ only by 4 degree F which is not a big difference. So there is good chance that the surf and ice-cream business can sustain in month of June as well as December.

Before summerizing anything it would be good idea to get more information on each months data like;

1.Precipation  difference between June and December to determine is one has more rainy weather.

2. Wind Conditions and wave swell. 
 
3. comaparison by weather station, as we may see higher/lower temperatures and precipitation levels at different locations. We would be primarily interested in the weather station closest to our prospective location, which would narrow the results and provide the best data for us to consider.
