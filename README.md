## Overview of the Analysis

### Background 

This project analyse the summary statistics of temperature data that were requested for the months of June and December, in order to determine if a prospective surf and ice-cream businesses can sustainably operate year-round as opposed to a seasonal business.

### Purpose 

Purpose of this analysis is to deliver:

* Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June

* Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December

* Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis (README.md)


## Results

Following images shows the result of the analysis for June and December Temperatures

June Temperatures

December Temperatures

* The average temperature in June is 75 degrees whereas in December its 71 degrees which says that there is no big difference in tempratures of both these months.

* Even though the average temp has no big deference if we look minimum and maximum temp December has lowest to 56 degrees and june has 64 degrees this is around 8 degree difference need to be considered. And Maximum temperature records has not a big difference. So lowest (56 degree F) temperature may not be sutaible for teh ice-cream and surf business. But before making any conclusion there are more things that should be considered.

* The standard daviation data shows there is possibility of variation(change in temp) for the month of december.

## Summary

Overall from the results it can be stated that,The average temperatures in June and December differ only by 4 degree F which is not a big difference. So there is good chance that the surf and ice-cream business can sustain in month of June as well as December.

Before summerizing anything it would be good idea to get more information on each months data, Queries to perform following:

* Precipation difference between June and December to determine is one has more rainy weather.

* Wind Conditions and wave swell. 
 
* Comaparison by weather station, as we may see higher/lower temperatures and precipitation levels at different locations. We would be primarily interested in the weather station closest to our prospective location, which would narrow the results and provide the best data for us to consider.
